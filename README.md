# Web-Technologies-Project
> A small business located in IIUM was proposed by group members of this project namely Largh-nest, a coffee popup stall precisely in front of the Kulliyyah of
> Architecture and Environmental Design (KAED). The stall offers a variety of choices for the customers such as coffees and Largh-nest’s very own signature drinks. 
> The choices range from classic pressed coffee that is Awal(espresso) to regular latte, from Malaysiano(Americano) to Micha(Mocha). Signature drinks range from 
> Affogato to Fruitessa. Add-ons are available to purchase with the drinks to flare up the beverage chosen and bring joy upon your daily coffee shots.

This project contributes to design and develop web pages using front-end web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API) to display the products of Largh-nest and help the work at home/people who prefer for the drinks to be delivered to them. Upon arrival at the website, the customer should be able to view the catch line for Largh-nest i.e, 
“Hidup sehidup-hidupnya”. Customer can order using order now button and get redirected to the menu page where they may choose to order espresso, coffee or signature drinks using forms. They should be able to make orders in the website which notifies the stall as well.
